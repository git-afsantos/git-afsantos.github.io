HAROS is a framework for quality assurance of ROS-based code, mostly based on static analysis - which consists on extracting information from the source code without executing it (and, sometimes, even without compiling it). Its main goal is the early detection of problems in the software development life cycle, which would otherwise go unnoticed into later stages or even into production.
