**Abstract:**
Modern industry is shifting towards flexible, advanced robotic systems to meet the increasing demand for custom-made products with low manufacturing costs and to promote a collaborative environment for humans and robots. As a consequence of this industrial revolution, some traditional, mechanical- and hardware-based safety mechanisms are discarded in favour of a safer, more dependable robot software. This work presents a case study of assessing and improving the internal quality of a European research mobile manipulator, operating in a real industrial environment, using modern static analysis tools geared for robotic software. Following an iterative approach, we managed to fix about 90% of the reported issues, resulting in code that is easier to use and maintain.
