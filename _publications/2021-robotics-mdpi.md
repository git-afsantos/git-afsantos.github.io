**Abstract:**
Software for robotic systems is becoming progressively more complex despite the existence of established software ecosystems like ROS, as the problems we delegate to robots become more and more challenging.
Ensuring that the software works as intended is a crucial (but not trivial) task, although proper quality assurance processes are rarely seen in the open-source robotics community.
This paper explains how we analyzed and improved a specialized path planner for steep-slope vineyards regarding its software dependability.
The analysis revealed previously unknown bugs in the system, with a relatively low property specification effort.
We argue that the benefits of similar quality assurance processes far outweigh the costs and should be more widespread in the robotics domain.
