**Abstract:**
This tool paper presents the High-Assurance ROS (HAROS) framework. HAROS is a framework for the analysis and quality improvement of robotics software developed using the popular Robot Operating System (ROS). It builds on a static analysis foundation to automatically extract models from the source code. Such models are later used to enable other sorts of analyses, such as Model Checking, Runtime Verification, and Property-based Testing. It has been applied to multiple real-world examples, helping developers find and correct various issues.
