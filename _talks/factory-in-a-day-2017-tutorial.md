At the beginning of February, 2017, the first Factory-in-a-day robot software integration workshop took place.
Together with other EU-funded projects working on ROS tools for scanning, testing, and deploying software, the goal was to bring together developers and system integrators in one workshop.
Here they could develop and test ROS tools that can be used to ensure software quality and reliable and quick deployment.
